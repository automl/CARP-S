      You must specify a problem instance and an optimizer instance by calling
      python carps/run.py +optimizer/{OPTIMIZER_TYPE}={OPTIMIZER_INSTANCE} +problem/{PROBLEM_TYPE}={PROBLEM_INSTANCE}

      == Required Config ==
      
      The following configs are required to execute a run
            
      problem: The benchmark to be evaluated. You could find all the problem types under `carps/configs/problem` and
          problem instances under `carps/configs/{YOUR_PROBLEM_TYPES}`
      
      optimizer: The optimizer applied to the benchmark. You could find all the optimizer types under
          `carps/configs/optimizer` and problem instances under `carps/configs/optimizer/`
      
      == Optional Config ==
      
      The following configs are optional and can be override by the user inputs

      seed: The random seed.
      
      task.n_trials: Optimization budget as number of evaluations.
      
      task.time_budget: Optimization budget as time in seconds
      
      task.min_budget: (multi-fidelity optimization only) the minimal budget that can be used to evaluate a problem
      
      task.max_budget: (multi-fidelity optimization only) the minimal budget that can be used to evaluate a problem
