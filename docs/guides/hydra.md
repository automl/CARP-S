# Hydra

In CARP-S, Hydra is used for handling the configuration of the benchmarking tasks
to be executed.

Hydra is a Python framework that simplifies the development of complex applications by enabling
their configuration to be dynamically composed and overridden, which is particularly useful
for applications that require a high degree of customization and flexibility.

For more information on Hydra, please refer to the
[Hydra documentation](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro).
