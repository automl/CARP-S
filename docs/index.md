# What is CARP-S?

CARP-S is a benchmarking framework for Comprehensive Automated Research Performance Studies, 
designed to evaluate multiple optimizers across various benchmark tasks. It aims to facilitate 
the development of effective and reliable methods for hyperparameter optimization (HPO).

-   :material-tune-vertical-variant: __Develop With Confidence__

    Developing optimizers is hard, evaluating them is harder and benchmarking
    against state-of-the-art is even harder. CARP-S provides a simple and easily extendable
    framework to develop, evaluate and benchmark **your** optimizer.

-   :material-arrow-all: __Various Scenarios__

    The benchmarks integrated in CARP-S offer tasks for blackbox, multi-fidelity, 
    multi-objective and multi-fidelity-multi-objective HPO, allowing you to evaluate
    your optimizer in a variety of scenarios.

-   :octicons-star-16: __Effective Evaluation__

    Fair comparisons between optimizers require evaluation on a large number of tasks, 
    which can be computationally infeasible. CARP-S provides a subset of representative 
    benchmarking tasks for each scenario to allow for effective evaluation.

-   :octicons-package-dependents-16: __Minimal Dependencies__

    CARP-S is modular and allows you to only install what you need to run and
    evaluate what you want. For details, please have a look at the
    [installation instructions](installation.md).
