# What is CARP-S?
Lorum ipsum some text

-   :material-tune-vertical-variant: Develop With Confidence

    Developing optimizers is hard, evaluating them is harder and benchmarkig
    against state-of-the-art is even harder. CARP-S provides a simple and
    framework to develop, evaluate and benchmark **your** optimizer.

-   :octicons-package-dependents-16: __Minimal Dependencies__

    CARP-S is modular and allows you to only install what you need to run and
    evaluate what you want.
